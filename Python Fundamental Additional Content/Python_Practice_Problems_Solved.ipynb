    "Problem-1: Breaking the records.\n",
    "Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "scores = [12, 24, 10, 24]\n",
    "Scores are in the same order as the games played. She tabulates her results as follows:\n",
    "Game\tScore\tMinimum\tMaximum\tCount Min\tCount Max\n",
